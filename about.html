        	<h1>History</h1>
      		<p>
           		On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under new
            	ownership. The new owners, the Rossi family, had transformed the
            	space from a tap bar into a restaurant that specialized in pizza and
	            sandwiches. In 1978, the Ambassador was expanded into the space next
            	door, and the second dining room was added. In January 2007, the
	            Ambassador became a non-smoking establishment. To explain the
	            history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line the
	            interior walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem
	            detailing the story. The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has
	            since been printed on the cover of the Ambassador menu. (see below
	            for full text) The first line of the poem mentions "Mr. Rohrbeck,"
	            who was “given a job to do.” Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was
	            commissioned by Joseph Bosch (born in Baden, Germany in 1850) to
	            paint the murals specifically for the Bosch brewery (closed in
	            1978). The murals were later placed in the "old Giltedge Bar."
	            Featuring gnomes in various states of celebration, the murals are
	            oil on canvas, with several coats of varnish on top for
	            preservation. The date that the paintings were sold to the
	            Ambassador and transferred from the Bosch Brewery is unclear, but
	            the transaction likely took place in the late 40s or early 50s
	            during a remodeling project. The Ambassador retains the original
	            charm and tradition of its original inception; in addition to the
	            murals, which have remained in place for over 50 years, the original
	            pizza recipe is still used to create the Ambassador pizzas.

        	<h1>Come Fill A Bumper</h1>
        	  <p>
        	    On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job
        	    to do.<br />
        	    With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the
        	    masterpiece on the wall above.<br />
        	    First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here,
        	    but not too far.<br />
        	    Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses,
        	    business was good.<br />
        	    Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old
        	    time.<br />
        	    Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a
        	    speakeasy, called “Hole in the Wall”<br />
        	    Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in the
        	    dust they lay.<br />
        	    At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus
        	    was free.<br />
        	    Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and
        	    drank spirits once more.<br />
        	    The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings
        	    were hung on the walls they now grace.<br />
        	    The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still
        	    enjoy them as much as they do.
